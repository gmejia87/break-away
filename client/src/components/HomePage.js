          Do you want the breakup to reflect your respect for your soon-to-be
          ex? Drop a bundle on singers, dancers, flowers, gourmet treats, a spa
          weekend.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do you want the breakup to convey a sense of rage, betrayal, and
          disdain? They can do that too.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do you just want to take a break without closing the door forever?
          Only professionals can say, ‘Don’t call me, I’ll call you’ without
          hurting anyone’s feelings.
          <br />
          <br />
          Away can send a quick notification to their facebook, or stage a troup
          professional choristers on their doorstep. It’s your call. Simply
          place your order and go ‘Away’.
