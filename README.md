# Break Away

## Description

In China, there is a long tradition of hiring professional mourners. These professionals ensure that the departed loved one is grieved with due solemnity. In the U.S. today, we often turn to professionals to carry out weddings or engagements, but we have no professionals to turn to when it’s time to end a relationship. We all look for new relationships online, but there’s no app to help us end relationships we already have.

Enter ‘Break Away’. Do you want the breakup to reflect your respect for your soon-to-be ex? Let the professionals at Away make sure it’s flawless. Drop a bundle on singers, dancers, flowers, gourmet treats, a spa weekend. Do you want the breakup to convey a sense of rage, betrayal, and disdain? They can do that too. Do you just want to take a break without closing the door forever? Only professionals can say, ‘Don’t call me. I’ll call you.’ without hurting anyone’s feelings. Away can send a quick notification to their facebook, or send a mariachi band to their doorstep. It’s your call. Simply place your order and 'Break Away.'

This MERN stack application provides functionality for Break Away users.
